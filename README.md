## ConvMixer on CIFARs in Pytorch

The original paper provides details about the architecture and hyper-parameters: [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=TVHS5Y4dNvM)

### Note

This repo is set-up to produce results on the CIFAR dataset with some standard `optimizer`, `schedulers` and `transforms` used for `CIFARs`

I'll be adding results soon.
